        <h2>Hi.</h2>
        <p>I am Sazzatul Islam Anik.
           I am a student of Computer Science dept. of MIST. Currently, I am learning Web Designing.
           As I am a student of CS background, I must have to learn Web Designing and Developing.
           So, I am now a newbie to Web Development. That's all. Thank You... ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š </p>

            <h2>What can I do.</h2>
            <p>Every person has some skills, skills are not that which everyone
               achieves for showing off, cause if anyones has that intension for achieveing
               skills he/she may not be able to be a skilled person. Skill is the thing which
               must be your passion, your dreams as well. If you have passion to something
               whateve the thing is and if you spend your times behind that, then you could be
               skilled on that field. My skills are not just skills, they are my passion as well.</p>

            <h3>C++</h3>
            <p>I do love this programming language very much. Beside software development, 
               I am a serious contest programming lover. I do contest regularly on Codeforces
               By this thime of my CS journey, I didn't achieved anything from this passion but
               I believe after sometime I could be able to do that. So, keep me in your
               prayers, Thank You.</p>

            <img class="photo2" width="10%" src="images/python.png" alt="python">
            <h3>Python</h3>
            <p>We know the fact about choosing Python over hundreds of Programming Languages.
               Now some of highly skilled Web Developers are using Python and Django framework
               for Web Development. Besides python is getting love from thousands of programmers
               because of It's easy and user friendly syntax and interface. I order to keep me
               up to date with the rapidly growing Web Development world I have mastered this
               masterpiece Python.</p>

            <img class="photo1" width="10%" src="images/java.png" alt="java">
            <h3>Java</h3>
            <p>Now for Java, I will say that in the beginning of App Development life everyone
               uses this because of It's rich resources over the internet. You are facing a 
               problem that anyone didn't face before, that could not be possibe. So everyone
               learns Java in the beginning of his or her App Development career. I'm also
               one of them.</p>

            <h3>Data Structures and Algorithms</h3>
            <p>As I have mentioned before that, I love contest programming. In order to do that 
               I must need to master the Data Structure and Algrithm Course and I have done this
               Amongst all off my skills it was that whicht make me swat. It was one of the hardest
               skills to achieve. I have a great knowledge over Complexity Analysis,
               Sorting Algorithms, Hashing, BST, Heap, Trees and Graphs and so on.</p>
